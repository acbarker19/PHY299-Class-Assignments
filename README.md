# PHY299 Class Assignments
A repository containing multiple small projects from my physics class, Scientific Modeling & Data Analysis, at the University of Mount Union that was taught by Dr. Colin Campbell.

This class utilizes libraries from Anaconda found here: https://www.anaconda.com/

Some exercises and problems come from "Learning Scientific Programming with Python" by Christian Hill.

Some code was provided by Dr. Colin Campbell and edited by Alec Barker.

It contains code for the following:
### Homework
- `Barker HW1`: Simple math calculations and comparisons
- `Barker HW2`: Modifying substrings and displaying values in a grid using an array
- `Barker HW3-1`: Zipping two arrays together and sorting
- `Barker HW3-2`: Looping numbers in an array and findind the product of every number except the current one
- `Barker HW3-3`: Finding factorials using only even or odd numbers
- `Barker HW3-4`: Demonstrated Benford's Law with the Fibonacci Sequence
- Homework Assignment 4
### In-Class Assignments
- Exercise about graphing binding energy
- Exercise about binding energy
- Exercise about graphing points to determine area under a curve
### Notes
- Notes about booleans
- Notes about conditional statements
- Notes about file input and output
- Notes about functions
- Notes about graphing data
- Notes about lists, tuples, and loops
- Notes about number data types
- Notes about the string data type

Various examples of working code are shown in notes and in homework assignments.
