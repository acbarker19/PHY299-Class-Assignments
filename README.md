A repository containing multiple small projects from my physics class, Scientific Modelling & Data Analysis, at the University of Mount Union that was taught by Dr. Colin Campbell.

This class utilizes libraries from Anaconda found here: https://www.anaconda.com/

Some exercises and problems come from "Learning Scientific Programming with Python" by Christian Hill.

Some code was provided by Dr. Colin Campbell and edited by Alec Barker.

It contains code for the following:
